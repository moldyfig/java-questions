Q: Identify a problem with this class.
A: If you instantiate WidgetConsumer using the default constructor
   and call consume() on it, you will get an NPE on Line 31:

   WidgetConsumer consumer = new WidgetConsumer();
   consumer.consume();  // Throws NPE

Q: How would you fix it?
A: Just create it in the default constructor
   Other options:
   - check for null before Line 31 (weakest)
   - wrap Line 31 in a try/catch block

Q: Are you familar with Test-Driven Development (TDD)?
   If the answer is yes:
   Q: Can you dedscribe it?

   Q: Why is the WidgetConsumer class hard to test?
   A: You have no control over the behavior of the producer
      from outside the class, because it always creates its own.

   Q: How would you improve the class so it's easier to test?
   A: Inject a producer from outside (dependency injection), e.g.

      public void setProducer(WidgetProducer producer) {
            this.producer = producer;
      }

      Then you can create a mock of a producer in your test
      that returns the results you know, and inject it.
